## Summary

**Twistor-Structural Quantum Vacuum Theory (TSQVT)** is a theoretical framework in which spacetime and particle mass are emergent phenomena. The theory posits that geometry is identified with a scalar structural field, $\rho(x)$, whose dynamics originate from a pre-geometric substrate described by a noncommutative twistor algebra.

[cite_start]This approach offers a new perspective on the interplay between inertia, geometry, and quantum dynamics, and provides conceptual solutions to long-standing problems such as the Higgs hierarchy problem and the unification of gravity with the Standard Model interactions [cite: 683-1517].

## About This Repository

[cite_start]This repository contains the Python code used to perform the phenomenological analyses of TSQVT, including the perturbative calculations for the hydrogen atom and the generation of the parameter exclusion plots [cite: 821-831, 1012-1016].

## 🚀 Installation

To clone the repository and set up the environment, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/KerymMacryn/VA-Theory.git](https://github.com/KerymMacryn/VA-Theory.git)
cd VA-Theory/codigo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⚙️ Usage

The main script performs the calculations and generates the figures. To run an example simulation:

```bash
python VA_simulations.py
```

[cite_start]This will calculate the energy shifts in the hydrogen atom and reproduce the $(\epsilon, R)$ parameter exclusion plot presented in the publication on the theory's rigorous formulation [cite: 1044-1068].
